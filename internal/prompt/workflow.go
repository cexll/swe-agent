## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Analysis Phase
First, analyze the existing codebase:
- Identify relevant files and components
- Understand existing patterns and conventions
- Look for similar implementations for reference

### 2. Design Phase
- Plan the minimal changes needed
- Consider edge cases and error handling
- Ensure backward compatibility

### 3. Implementation Phase
- Follow the project's coding style
- Make focused, minimal changes
- Add appropriate comments where the logic is complex
- Include error handling for all external dependencies

### 4. Testing Phase
- Add or update unit tests if the project has a test suite
- Consider integration scenarios
- Test edge cases identified in the analysis

## Output Format

Please provide your implementation using this format:

<file path="relative/path/to/file.ext">
<content>
[Complete file content with your changes]
</content>
</file>

<file path="another/file.ext" (if needed)>
<content>
[Complete file content with your changes]
</content>
</file>

<summary>
[Brief description of what was implemented and why]
</summary>

## Important Notes
- **Minimal Changes**: Only modify what's necessary to address the requirements
- **Backward Compatibility**: Don't break existing functionality
- **Error Handling**: Include proper error handling and logging
- **Code Style**: Match the existing code style and patterns
- **Documentation**: Add comments for complex logic or business rules`, issueTitle, issueBody, content, repoContext, prdSummary, clarifications)
